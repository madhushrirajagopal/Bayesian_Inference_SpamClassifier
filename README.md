## Bayesian_Inference_SpamClassifier

My Learning for Naive Bayes Algorithm using email spam classifier example from Udacity.

This project has been broken down in to the following steps:

Step 0: Introduction to the Naive Bayes Theorem

Step 1.1: Understanding our dataset

Step 1.2: Data Preprocessing

Step 2.1: Bag of Words(BoW)

Step 2.2: Implementing BoW from scratch

Step 2.3: Implementing Bag of Words in scikit-learn

Step 3.1: Training and testing sets

Step 3.2: Applying Bag of Words processing to our dataset.

Step 4.1: Bayes Theorem implementation from scratch

Step 4.2: Naive Bayes implementation from scratch

Step 5: Naive Bayes implementation using scikit-learn

Step 6: Evaluating our model

Step 7: Conclusion 

To learn and solve, you can find the project notebook [here](NLP-Exercises/1.5-spam-classifier/Bayesian_Inference.ipynb).
